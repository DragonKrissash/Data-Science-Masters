With apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this weekFBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clintons email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didnt hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. 
As we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently disco...",1

2,Why the Truth Might Get You Fired,Consortiumnews.com,"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 
The tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. 
By Lawrence Davidson 
For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. 
Back in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the countrys dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for regime change in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Dire...",1

12,Russian Researchers Discover Secret Nazi Military Base Treasure Hunter in the Arctic [Photos],Amando Flavio,"The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers. Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period.

Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.
Nazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.
During the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named Schatzgraber or Treasure Hunter, which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base ...",1

The so-called Arab spring has brought many changes in its wake. However, war being one of the most important outcomes of this spring, certain changes in the erstwhile foreign policy orientation of many countries, big and small alike, was expected. To this particular outcome owes the growth of China-Israel relations that continue to develop stronger and deeper every year.

32,"Having Won, Boris Johnson and Brexit Leaders Fumble - The New York Times",Steven Erlanger,"LONDON     With their giddy celebrations of independence day having given way to political and economic turmoil, one thing has become especially clear about the former London mayor Boris Johnson and other leaders of the successful campaign to vote Britain out of the European Union: They had no plan for what comes next. In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc, the movements leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences. Faced with the scope of the decision, they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations. They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions. Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and, arguably, to the turmoil in the financial markets. And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr. Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continen...",0

For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. I dont see a future, Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot.  Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs     just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back.

Donald Trump is not the president yet, and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House. Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as the danger zone, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trumps victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard.

The Podesta emails - After Hillary, John Podesta had been seriously warned about the Syrian chaos Posted by: nmb | Nov 18, 2016 1:59:59 PM | 1 
Although it is hilarious to see the Hillary supporters throwing a massive tantrum about 'fake news,' it does make it clear just how powerful having direct access to information is in negating money, mainstream media capture and control, and government propaganda. 
I don't know how much the new Trump presidency will change the US intelligence agency culture. But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. 
It should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation:

39,Avoiding Peanuts to Avoid an Allergy Is a Bad Strategy for Most - The New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,"This article originally ran in April. We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy.  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy, out of concern that their children could become allergic to them: shellfish, dairy and, most of all, peanuts. After their babies arrive, they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them. But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good. In many cases, we need to be doing the opposite. Mothers didnt adopt this behavior out of nowhere. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a childs risk for developing allergies.

41,4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Arent Dairy,Alexandria Laredo,"  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesnt actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink.

60,The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax Overhaul - The New York Times,Neil Irwin,"The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If theres one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation.

The audience is invited to imagine a   time     1986, to be precise     before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) who accidentally travels more than 1, 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Saroos mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Lu...",0

In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few.

For a third time, a federal judge has affirmed a nationwide injunction against the Obama administrations agenda to impose mandatory open-restroom policies on schools from coast to coast, scolding the White House for repeating old arguments and catching those who submitted the newest arguments in a lie. 
The ruling this week from U.S. District Judge Reed OConnor left intact his nationwide injunction against Obamas decision that transgender public school students can use the restroom of their choice, rather than the restroom designated for their physical sex. 
The White House issued the order some months ago, and when several states sued, OConnor found in August that they were likely to prevail in their arguments, so he suspended implementation of the program nationwide. 
In October, when he had to address the issue again because of demands from the White House, he doubled down, stating, It is clear from Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent that this court has the power to issue a...",1

105,10 Images That Perfectly Illustrate the Struggle Against the Dakota Access Pipeline,The Anti-Media,"
By Nick Bernabe
The struggle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline has been mired in police brutality and militarization. In fact, many have likened the atmosphere in Standing Rock, North Dakota, to a war zone.
The corporate media initially refused to cover the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, though the ongoing storys virality on social media eventually forced it into the mainstream. Even now that the #NoDAPL movement has developed into a national political narrative, the media continues to whitewash the severity of the crackdown against the Native American protesters, who call themselves water protectors.
Below are 10 images I have come across (while closely following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests for Anti-Media ) that narrate the struggle at Standing Rock:

131,The Beautiful Prehistoric World: Is Earth Now a Wasteland?,Editor,"By Pao Chang
Earth is a beautiful blue planet that has gone through many changes. Some people believed that Earth used to be a world filled with mythical creatures and magic. Others believed it used to have a landscape that is more beautiful than the picture below.
The following two videos reveal some very interesting information about what Earth may look like tens of thousands of years ago or possibly hundreds of thousands of years ago. Did Earth use to have trees as large as small mountains? Are there actually no forests on Earth? Is Earth now a wasteland? The videos below might have clues to help answer these questions.

132,I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Heres What I Learned. - The New York Times,Farhad Manjoo,"I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didnt read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president. What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an Oprah Winfrey Show tape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder. It wasnt my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours) but shifted most of my energy to looking for   zones. My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no   part of the press. But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosyste...",0

The proposals, which Mr. Trump outlined in the politically critical Philadelphia suburbs along with his daughter Ivanka, represent a new attempt to court female voters who polls show have been alienated by his bombast and history of provocative remarks about women. Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the   factory worker, the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford child care, Mr. Trump said at a rally here. Mr. Trumps decision to put forward such a plan represents a different approach from the one taken by previous Republican presidential nominees.

Heres a letter to the Wall Street Journal :
Wilbur Rosss and Peter Navarros defense of Donald Trumps economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum ( A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth , Oct. 26). Consider this claim: Donald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation & and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports&.
Cut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americans commerce with foreigners.
As for eliminating our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such success would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment.

Loree, acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears, Mr. Loree said, adding that he believed such a move was not imminent. The sale of Craftsman, valued at more than $775 million, was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising   cash for Sears. For Sears, selling one of its classic brands     one it created nearly a century ago     is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump. Edward S.

166,Takata Chief Executive to Resign as Financial Pressure Mounts - The New York Times,Jonathan Soble,"TOKYO     The chief executive of Takata said on Tuesday that he would step down, as the embattled car parts supplier looks to attract   financial support to deal with the fallout from the largest automotive safety recall in history. The decision by the chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, reflects the financial pressure on Takata, which lost nearly $130 million last year. The company is in danger of buckling under the cost of the recall without a lifeline. His departure is the inevitable price of a cash infusion from new investors, who would most likely want a clean management slate. And any financial rescue would most likely mean shrinking the influence of the Takada family, which founded company in the 1930s and remains the largest shareholder. The resignation of Mr. Takada, the grandson of the founder, has been assumed for a while but never publicly discussed. In the more than two years after Takata was engulfed in a crisis over dangerously defective airbags, automakers have recalled 60 million vehicles ...",0

Over the course of the 2016 presidential election, Americans who rail against Hillary Clinton have condemned the medias bias in her favor  and rightfully so. Clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media  whose parent companies often donate to her  with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. 
But as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind Hillary Clinton  and hardly anyone is talking about it. 
Though outrage over Clintons corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like Goldman Sachs , Citibank, JP Morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate Hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks.

They were ripping a page from history as they did it: During his 42 years in power, Colonel Qaddafi sponsored numerous acts of international airline terrorism, including hijackings and the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988 that killed 270 people. Yet unlike most   airline dramas, this one was resolved easily. Within hours of landing in Malta, the two hijackers had released the other 115 people aboard and had surrendered peacefully to the Maltese authorities. Their weapons     a pistol and a grenade     turned out to be replicas. Libyan officials said the two men had asked for visas to Europe. But the hijacking, and its stated inspiration, did point to the enduring chaos of Libya, a country with three rival governments that, despite United   peace efforts, remains fragile and deeply unstable five years after Co...",0

198,Could Teaching Men to Nurture Counteract Our Culture of Toxic Masculinity?,nan,"By Ann Deslandes / thevocal.com.au 
The feminist and feminist-adjacent internet had a mild implosion in February in response to an article by Canadian organiser, writer, and college professor Nora Samaran (a pseudonym). Titled The opposite of rape culture is nurturance culture , Samaran proposes that the solution to rape culture and other manifestations of gendered abuse lies in the inverse of violence, which she says is nurturance  that is,a deep capacity to create safety and trust that many men are not permitted to develop in patriarchal culture.

What is This New Treatment? The newly developed cancer treatment involves the human protein GcMAF (Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor). GcMAF works by activating macrophages that are already present within the human body. These macrophages can fight against and destroy cancerous cells.
GcMAF is produced naturally inside the body however some people cannot make enough levels of this vital human protein to ward off disease and infection. The idea is that by administering this protein to people, the immune system can be strengthened to fight cancer and reducing the need for more intense, invasive procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

You might think Im joking. But Im not. Yes, the accepted perception of cannabis aka marijuanas effect on the brain is normally forgetfulness and goofy behavior, so one may not normally think cannabis would be a positive influence for any stage of dementia or Alzheimers. 
While in office, president Ronald Reagan declared: & the most reliable scientific sources say permanent brain damage is one of the inevitable results of the use of marijuana. 
That declaration was based on a lone Tulane study authored by Dr. Robert G. Heath that force fed pot smoke into monkeys wearing masks, which gave them virtually no options of breathing normal air, equivalent to 30 joints daily for 90 days, after which the monkeys withered away and died. 
Although autopsies confirmed many brain cells were damaged, critics claimed the monkeys brain cells suffered from oxygen deprivation, not from cannabis THC. Many attempts to duplicate Heaths study failed. Evidently it was only designed and executed to satisfy th...",1

Now all Mr. Bunch and a team of colleagues had to do was find an unprecedented number of private donors willing to finance a public museum. They had to secure hundreds of millions of additional dollars from a Congress, Republican controlled, that had long fought the project. And they had to counter efforts to locate the museum not at the center of Washingtons cultural landscape on the National Mall, but several blocks offstage. I knew it was going to be hard, but not how hard it was going to be, Mr. Bunch, 63, said in an interview last month.

A case in point is the funding McAuliffe arranged for Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of the future deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. McAuliffe steered nearly $500,000 from his political action committee, Common Good VA, and another approximately $200,000 from the Virginia Democratic Party to Mrs. McCabe for her state senate campaign in 2015.

Indeed, both have appeared very hawkish against Russia, and Obama apparently doesnt want to deny Clinton a chance to participate in the early days of a war shed inherit. 
Starting a cyberwar ahead of a Trump win would be even less wise, as Trump has opposed the idea of picking fights with Russia, and expressed strong doubts about Democratic Party certainty that Russia is behind hacks against them.

Fitzsimmons,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had good news on Monday for subway riders worried about the shutdown of the L train: The closing will be shorter than expected.

The work is set to begin in April 2019. After several board members raised concerns about a company that was awarded the contract, Judlau Contracting, officials assured the board that the company was the best choice for the project and would finish the work on time. I expect this project to be completed in 15 months, said Lawrence S.

301,What Time Will the Presidency Be Decided? - The New York Times,Nate Cohn,"It has been a very, very long election season. But we will soon know the result. Hillary Clinton enters Election Day with a clear if not insurmountable advantage over Donald J. Trump. If the polls and conventional wisdom are correct, we might know the result fairly quickly. If not, it could be a long night. The final national polls give Mrs. Clinton a   lead, and her path to the presidency is straightforward: win the states carried by John Kerry in 2004, in addition to New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. She has led in nearly every live interview survey of those states so far this year, though the large number of white   voters in many of these states gives Mr. Trump a shot at an upset. Mrs. Clinton is also competitive in North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Arizona. If she won all four, she would have a sizable victory in the Electoral College. The Upshots model gives Mr. Trump a 16 percent chance of winning the presidency. It would certainly be a big upset, but it would not even be the most stunning...",0

Hardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of Syrians. Even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information. 
In July 2013, according to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the death toll in Syria exceeded 100 thousand.  
In October 2014, the Jordanian prince and UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, determined the number of people killed in Syria to be 200,000.  
By October 2015, according to UN figures, the number of killed in Syria was more than 240,000. 
In September 2016, the UN officially presented the figure of 300,000 Syrians killed and more than half of the Syrian population as refugees.

That a leader of the Peoples Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months. His message, delivered here in the Swiss Alps at the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum, appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand.

Ms. Stein has cited concerns about computer hacking and the reliability of voting machines, setting off legal fights with lawyers for   Donald J. Trump, his campaign and his allies, who view the recounts as a needless and expensive tactic. A panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals found that Ms. Stein, who finished a distant fourth to Mr. Trump in the election, had not met the states requirements for a recount because she had no chance of winning.

312,The shortest and most powerful explanation of Trump's victory I have ever seen,Zach Cartwright,"Zach Cartwright | November 11, 2016 
The Democrats staggeringly piss-poor performance Tuesday night resulting in Donald Trumps victory can be summed up in one word: Turnout. 
Hillary Clinton would have won had she focused her message more on appealing to white, working-class voters in rust belt states like Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. As this New York Times map of the 2012 election shows, President Obama won all of those states in 2012. Obama also won roughly 2.6 million more votes than Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Donald Trumps narrow margin of victory in the Electoral College was only possible by winning all of the aforementioned rust belt states . 
There was hardly any enthusiasm behind Hillary Clinton when examining exit poll results. In an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos exit polling, Times writer Sarah Jaffe found several revealing trends showing why Clinton was a poor choice for the Democrats in terms of motivating voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots for their party...",1

Bugaev surveyed a   wasteland that the Russian government is offering to   pioneers under its own   version of the 1862 Homestead Act in the United States. This is not really what I had in mind, said Mr. Bugaev, who had traveled across seven time zones from St. Petersburg, Russia, to scout the possibilities for settlers in the countrys sparsely populated Far East, a territory roughly   the size of the United States. The nine Far Eastern regions targeted for settlement in the governments land giveaway, which began on June 1, encompass more than a third of Russia but are home to only 6. 1 million people. This is just 4 percent of the countrys population and compares with the 110 million Chinese living across the border in the three provinces that make up Manchuria.

But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics. Under the provision, which was made in 1954,   entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. If they do, they risk losing their   status. Considered uncontroversial at the time, it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Today, however, many Republicans want to repeal it.

324,Whats at stake in the US election?,Editorial,"United States By ORIENTAL REVIEW 
The outcome of the 2016 presidential election will show that the American political system  as we have known it  will apparently cease to exist. Trump is nothing like those Republican pawns who, along with the puppets of the Democratic party, have spent the last 40 years erecting the facade of American democracy. It really looks like he is ready to make good on the threat he made even prior to the Republican National Convention  to send millions of his supporters into the streets. 
Today Trump represents an entirely new party made up of half of the American electorate, and they are ready for action. And whatever the eventual political structure of this new model, this is what is shaping Americas present reality. Moreover, this does not seem like such a unique situation.

He claimed,  hyperbolically, that Mrs. Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, wants to take away your guns.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is the most     Amendment candidate ever to run for office, he said. Mrs. Clinton has called for tightened restrictions on guns, but not for abolishing the right to own them.

It is a cliché by now that Donald Trump has run a reality show campaigna series of gaffes, surprises, outrages, weirdnesses, explosions, revelations, and just every other ingredient that comprise the popular TV genre of faux authenticity. On reality TV, the subjects are seldom artists or entertainers or high achievers in any field. They are personalities. Their roles are their lives, which creates a Möbius strip. What do the Kardashians actually do besides being on their show, which has, of course, generated all sorts of commercial opportunities that almost make it seem as if they are doing something? What is their talent, other than the talent for self-promotion? 
All of this was anticipated 54 years ago by historian Daniel Boorstin in The Image , in which he defined a celebrity as someone who is known for being well-known. In a previous post , I discussed h...",1

343,115 Million Americans Killed In 30 Minutes,Dave Hodges,"

It is called the SS-18, the Satan for short. As Obama has gutted military preparedness, Putin has busily been doing the opposite. The Russian military is capable of wiping our large swaths of this country in less than an afternoon.
The title of this piece is 115 million Americans killed in 30 minutes. Thirty minutes is the approximate time that an SS-18, launched from inside Russia, would reach the Eastern Seaboard, where 5 of these missiles would destroy the entire east coast in which 115 million Americans would perish with scarcely a trace. The casualty figures come from Paul Craig Roberts.
When will the bulk of Americans realize that they have been sold out under a treasonous chief executive? You will scarcely believe your eyes and ears in the following report as you are about to learn that we are Russias mercy.

364,Is Hillary Panicking Over the FBI and Weiner Emails?,Daniel Greenfield,"Is Hillary Panicking Over the FBI and Weiner Emails?   
These past few days have seen a major shift in the Clinton tactics. During the original investigation, the Clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at Republicans for ""wasting time"" investigating Hillary, but did not attack the FBI. It misrepresented FBI statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way we're seeing now. 
But now we have open hostilities between Lynch at the DOJ and the FBI. We have the Clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the FBI. We have countless media hit pieces aimed at the FBI. 
The obvious question is why. The Clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. It certainly didn't begin an ill-advised campaign against the FBI. That's the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. That is to say everyone who isn't in the media. 
So what's going on here?

Over the course of the 2016 presidential election, Americans who rail against Hillary Clinton have condemned the medias bias in her favor  and rightfully so. Clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media  whose parent companies often donate to her  with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. 
But as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind Hillary Clinton  and hardly anyone is talking about it. 
Though outrage over Clintons corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like Goldman Sachs , Citibank, JP Morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate Hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks.

The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. 
But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable.

The provocative news and opinion website that Mr. Bannon ran, Breitbart News, has repeatedly published articles linking migrants to the spread of disease. Its authors have criticized politicians who do not support a religious test for immigrants to screen out potential jihadists. And it has promoted stories that tried to tie Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton who is Muslim, to Islamic militants. In an interview, Mr. Bannon, 62, rejected what he called the   tendencies of some in the movement.

It started when Daniel Blatman, an Israeli historian and head of the Institute for Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, penned an op-ed for the Israeli daily Haaretz stating that ethnic cleansing is exactly what happened in 1948. To support this, Blatman cited Benny Morris: the Israeli historian, Blatman wrote, determined that most of the Arabs in the country, over 400,000, were encouraged to leave or expelled in the first stage of the wareven before the Arab nations armies invaded. [2] Benny Morris, October 30, 2007 ( Aude / CC BY-SA 2.0 ) 
That prompted a response from Morris, who wrote an op-ed of his own titled Israel Conducted No Ethnic Cleansing in 1948.

After a few relatively peaceful days at the campground, where thousands have gathered to demonstrate against a controversial North Dakota oil pipeline, demonstrators put out calls on social media to make your way to the river for a river action, but to do so in prayer.

The most colonized and exploited continent in the history of the world is once more the center of global competition, albeit this time the form of rivalry between the Great Powers has taken on a much more nuanced, though no less intense, form. The US, France, and their unipolar allies want to retain Africa as their exclusive labor, market, and resource reserve for the foreseeable future, both out of their own material self-interest and with the added strategic benefit of depriving China and others of its economic fruits. Contrarily, China wants to integrate the worlds fastest growing economies and populations into the unfolding multipolar world order and give them a fair chance at succeeding in the global system. The contrast between the Wests neo-colonialism and Chinas liberating sovereignty couldnt be more crisp, and its this opposition of diametrically opposed global strategies and development models that sets the stage for the g...",1

Samantha Bee, now the host of her own show, traveled to Moscow to interview two of the thinkfluencers, members of Putins underground troll farms that pose as Americans online and flood social media with pro-Russian and pro-Trump propaganda. 
The reason Im hired is to make simple people change their mind about their vote and also about Russia said one woman, who admitted she identifies herself as a Nebraskan housewife online. When asked why they thought their propaganda was working, she replied it was because Americans are lazy and they believe everything they read.",1

629,Bill Clinton Said White Middle-class Life Expectancy Declined During Obama Years,Warren Mass,"Email 
Speaking at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in Canton, Ohio, last November, former President Bill Clinton (right) expressed disappointment concerning a then-recent Democratic presidential candidates debate, during which, he said, there was not a single mention of the fact that 84 percent of the American people, after inflation, had not had a raise of 1 cent since the financial crash. 
The financial crash of which Clinton spoke began in late 2007 and extended into 2008  the year Barack Obama was elected president. Though his administration was not responsible for the crash, when Clinton spoke last year, Obama had been president for more than six years. Therefore, Clintons observations indicated that the vast majority of Americans had made no financial progress during Obamas entire first term and half of his second term. 
Britains Daily Mail reported that the former presidents speech was published by WikiLeaks as part of the websites release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podestas e-mails.

Comey released a vague memo when he had little more to go on other than a mere suspicion and is now facing bipartisan calls for removal from office.

631,Memo to Trump: 'Action This Day!',Pat Buchanan,"  => 
In victory, magnanimity! said Winston Churchill. 
Donald Trump should be magnanimous and gracious toward those whom he defeated this week, but his first duty is to keep faith with those who put their faith in him. 
The protests, riots and violence that have attended his triumph in city after city should only serve to steel his resolve. 
As for promptings that he reach out and reassure those upset by his victory, and trim or temper his agenda to pacify them, Trump should reject the poisoned chalice. This is the same old con. 
Trump should take as models the Democrats FDR and LBJ. 
Franklin Roosevelt, who had savaged Herbert Hoover as a big spender, launched his own New Deal in his first 100 days. 
History now hails his initiative and resolve. 
Lyndon Johnson exploited his landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964 to erect his Great Society in 1965: the Voting Rights Act, Medicare and Medicaid. He compromised on nothing, and got it all.

657,Koch Brothers Secretly Allied w. George Soros for Hillary Clinton,Eric Zuesse.,"Posted on November 6, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse The leading financiers of the Republican Party, the Koch brothers, were exposed on November 4th by the great investigative journalist Lee Fang, as being solid supporters and heavy financiers of congressional candidates who have been leaders in expanding the U.S. military budget and moving America toward a police state (including militarization of the police). The leading financier of the Democratic Party, George Soros, has long been known to provide major financial backing for the most-neoconservative Democratic candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, who favor every possible military invasion and coup (and see this , for more on that). In fact, Soros was one of the top three financial backers (the other two were the U.S. government and the Netherlands government) for the television station in Ukraine that championed extermination of the people in Ukraines Donbass region, where the coup-imposed government, which he helped to install, is loathed .

Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters on Sunday that the search had expanded beyond the four men thought to be under consideration and that Mr. Trump planned to interview additional candidates early this week.

It is how much     or, more precisely, how little     they can pay in premiums each month. And for many of them, especially those who are healthy, all the prices are too high. The unexpected laser focus on price has contributed to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses among the countrys top insurers, as fewer healthy people than expected have signed up.

Hafnarfjorður, Iceland. 
The votes are in. In a greater-than-expected 79% turnout, election results show that Icelands Pirate Party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case. They have, however, increased their size in the Parliament 3-fold (from 3 seats to 10) but this will not be enough to steer Iceland in their direction. 
Now it´s all about coalition building. 
Had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer (at a one-time high of 35%), that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the Left-Greens, the Social-Democrats, or the center-leftish Bright Future. As it stands now, they will need to band together, something they all they agreed to consider during a pre-election press conference. 
The largest single party remains the corporate-right Independence Party with 29% or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center-right Progressive Party (who suffered a humili...",1

I had planned my route away from the creek, and I hadnt seen bear scat in more than an hour. As I crested a hill, a crash sounded from my right, and I instinctively moved to the left, expecting a moose. But it was the sow with three cubs. The cubs fled up a tree. The sow paused in front of me, as if waiting. I backed into the brush, fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees, moving slowly, carefully, never taking my eyes off the bear. When it veered as if to leave I felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my ...",0

These workers receive wages and benefits that are, on average, about 17 percent higher than workers with comparable skills and education in other parts of the economy.  The compensation gap is striking. The workers in the protected sector are better compensated than unprotected peers at every level of educational attainment aside from those with professional degrees or doctorates.

The Syria conundrum 
The crisis in Syria is getting more complicated. Many parties are participating in the war. The administration of US President Barack Obama has been talking about sending more sophisticated weapons to the so-called moderate rebels in Syria. But the White House is hesitant and the plan seems to have stalled. The Turks are after for their own agenda in Syria. Its been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria. According to Ankara, the mission is aimed at clearing its border area of ISIL militants and anti-Turkey Kurdish militants. And that has put Turkey on a collision course with the US, which has invested heavily on the Kurdish fighters.

677,Were in a Low-Growth World. How Did We Get Here? - The New York Times,Neil Irwin,"One central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the years remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth. The United States is adding jobs at a healthy clip, as a new report showed Friday, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. But that is happening despite a   trend of much lower growth, both in the United States and other advanced nations, than was evident for most of the   War II era. This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J.

By John Chuckman 
Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis, there are some observations, which deserve attention and which unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons (and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy, enlightenment and progressivity). 
The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever, and better than has been generally recognized, that America is, indeed, a plutocracy. It took a genuine American oligarch, a self-proclaimed billionaire, a man with a lifetimes economic empire-building, to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically well-connected, a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well ev...",1

But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, coup has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseffs political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that.

Americans are being told by experts (read Hillary supporters) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired. Once the vote is recorded the code erases the elements that would reveal the fraud. 
The entire purpose of the presstitutes reporting a non-existent Hillary lead is to create in advance acceptance that she won, thereby discrediting in advance any challenge to the rigged outcome.

756,Tory Councillor Say Homeless People Should Be Eliminated,Carol Adl,"  Carol Adl in News , UK // 0 Comments 
A Tory councillor believes that homeless people in Bradford city centre should be grabbed by scruff of the neck and dealt with. 
The comments by David Heseltine, a Conservative Party Councillor in Bradford caused outrage during a meeting of the Councils regeneration overview and scrutiny committee. He said : 
The tramps and drunks sleeping in doorways. What we need to do is get them by the scruff of the neck and deal with them. People have said theyd go into Bradford if they were eliminated. 
He claimed that while plans to redevelop the city centre were all well and good, the investment had been ruined by the homeless. 
So what exactly does Mr Heseltine envisage when he suggests grabbing the homeless by the scruff of the neck and eliminating them? 
EvolvePolitics reports: 
Why Councillor Heseltine believes that perpetrating an assault on the homeless would rectify the problem is a mystery. He would be better advised to encourage his colleagues to work towar...",1

The   home rental service on Friday settled the lawsuit that it filed against New York City two months ago. The suit challenged a New York law that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in October. That law called for fines of as much as $7, 500 for illegally listing a property on a rental platform such as Airbnb. The company had said the large fines could have deterred hosts and impaired its revenue in New York City. Hosts in the city generated about $1 billion in revenue last year, and the company took a cut of that in fees. But Airbnb on Friday agreed that it would drop the suit as long as New York City enforces the new law only against hosts and does not fine Airbnb. The settlement takes effect on Monday.

765,Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs - The New York Times,Claire Cain Miller,"Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now theyve declared a different winner: the robots. The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as   of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M. I. T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots. The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year, they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels.

Sweden is on the brink of becoming a lawless state as the police force is losing the battle against unprecedented levels of crime and violence amid a growing migrant crisis. 
The Scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. 
If the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by New Years. 
Since the migrant crisis began last summer, Sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . 
In 2015 alone Sweden, with a population of 9.5 million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016.

It sharply increases military spending while cutting the budgets of federal agencies and programs, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. It is a gamble for a politician whose supporters include   workers who rely on many of the programs he proposes to reduce, including grants that feed hungry children and help local law enforcement. This will be a heavy lift for the House, and for the Senate, a lot of this will be nonstarters, said former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who chaired the Budget Committee.

Johnson to television on Saturday night in an adaptation of the Robert Schenkkan play All the Way, and its still quite a sight to behold, just as it was on Broadway in 2014. Nothing beats witnessing this kind of    portrayal onstage, of course. But the television version, presented by HBO, offers plenty of rewards, allowing Mr. Cranston to work the   and liberating him from the confines of a theater set. In his hands, this accidental president comes across as an amazing bundle of contradictions, someone who seems at once too vulgar for the job and just right for it. Mr. Schenkkan adapted his own play (which also won a Tony) for HBO, and he and the director, Jay Roach, have quickened the pace a bit. The slice of history, though, remains the same: Johnsons pivotal first year in office, from his swearing in after John F. Kennedys assassination through his 1964 campaign for election to a full term. The first half of the film, its most ...",0

According to a report in the New Yorker, James Comey , Big Kahuna of the FBI, went full-on cowboy in releasing details of the new Clinton email inquiry. Apparently, the Department of Justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election. 
Gosh. I wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was Donald Trump who was being investigated by the FBI. 
Comey explained his decision in a letter to FBI employees :

The question is, are there people in the DOJ and FBI with enough pull to have the courage to tell the truth, or will their efforts be stonewalled by the likes of Hillary shill Loretta Lynch and Peter Kadzik.

A bombshell of new audio is exposing Hillary Clinton for the immoral, politically motivated opportunist that she is. Now the question is, will this impact her race for the White House? 
Some ten years ago (more recent than Donald Trumps now infamous locker room talk recording) in September of 2006, Hillary Clinton was running for reelection to the Senate when she sat down to speak with the editorial board of the Jewish Press.

Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the Middle East into their battlefield. Rather than fighting directly, they wield and in that way worsen the regions direst problems: dictatorship, militia violence and religious extremism. The history of their rivalry tracks     and helps to explain     the Middle Easts disintegration, particularly the   sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate. It is a story in which the United States has been a supporting but constant player, most recently by backing the Saudi war in Yemen, which kills hundreds of civilians.

One likely winner to come out of the 2016 US presidential election: accuracy in polling. Obviously not past but future polling!

Well, at least not in the safety and camaraderie of their rallies; although also aware that politically correct America frowned on such openness, leaving them with a bi-forked tongue when applied to people who would likely judge, or categorize them . . . and that definitely applied to pollsters.

Europe - if you can't stand up for your children, who will? Of course there is the fact that Western Europe has supported the US in their violent destruction of the Middle East over the past 20 years.

One of the most pervasive dangerous food myths has been the lipid hypothesis or theory of heart disease. It proclaims that eating foods containing saturated fats are the root cause of obesity and heart disease. It has prevailed for over a half-century and is only now beginning to deteriorate. 
It was originally created by University of Minnesota researcher Ancel Keys with his  Seven Countries Study that spawned the lipid theory of heart disease. This theory claims that saturated fats create cholesterol and cholesterol clogs arteries and induces heart disease and heart attacks.

The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink.

Mr. Trump gave no evidence to support his claim, and current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they do not believe Ms. Rices actions were unusual or unlawful. The president repeatedly rebuffed attempts by two New York Times reporters to learn more about what led him to the conclusion, saying he would talk more about it at the right time.  The allegation by a sitting president was a remarkable escalation     and, his critics say, the latest effort to change the story at a time when his nascent administration has been consumed by questions about any role his associates may have played in a Russian...",0

1001,Hillary To Be Arrested?,Mike Rivero,"October 29, 2016 
Writes Graham Dugas: 
Comey has an insurrection on his hands beyond the ability of anyone to control. These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice&give us Hillarys head on a platter and we will be silent on Obamas complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration. OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiners laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted ...",1

1003,"Donald Trump, Michael Phelps, Zika: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the  .) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1.  Donald Trump seemed to suggest that gun rights backers could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton nominated judges who favor gun control. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks, Mr. Trump said at a rally in North Carolina. Although the Second Amendment people     maybe there is, I dont know.  His campaign maintained that he was referring to political activism, but Mrs. Clintons campaign manager responded: What Trump is saying is dangerous.  _____ 2. Heres another way  this presidential election stands out. This time, donors whose Republican candidates have left the race are not shifting their support to the Republican nominee, but rather channeling their money across party lines to Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clintons campaign is also seeing a rare opening in Utah, where Mormons     who prize religious freedom     have been shaken by Mr. Trumps proposal to bar Muslims from imm...",0

Barack Obama was at home in the White House when he received a little gift from Donald Trumps fed-up deplorables, who interrupted his taxpayer-funded rest and relaxation with 41,000 things he never saw coming. These blunt patriots werent messing around, and they sent a clear message to our lame duck president, who didnt like it at all. 
The leader of the free world hasnt done much in his two terms of trying, and hes not about to start now on his way out of office. He has taken the liberty of awarding himself substantial tee time, only reserving his efforts and energy to promote who he hopes to be his successor, Hillary Clinton. As annoying at it is to watch him do nothing, its worse to see him take a side to campaign with one candidate while slandering the other, which Donald Trumps supporters have noticed and are fed-up over it.

Pollak,"On April 29, Los Angeles marks the 25th anniversary of the riots that engulfed the city in 1992 following the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers who were videotaped beating motorist Rodney King. [Three of the four officers were white King, who died in 2012, was black. (Two officers were later convicted in a federal civil rights trial.)  As Bay Area public radio station KQED recalls: Fury over the acquittal     stoked by years of racial and economic inequality in the city     spilled over into the streets, resulting in five days of rioting in Los Angeles. It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today.   &     The acquittals were announced around 3 p. m. less than three hours later, the unrest began. Residents set fires, looted and destroyed liquor stores, grocery stores, retail shops and fast food restaurants.   motorists     both white and Latino     were targeted some were pulled out of their cars and be...",0
